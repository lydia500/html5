				<h2>How is VR being used Today</h2>
				<p>Unsurprisingly, the video games industry is one of the largest proponents of Virtual Reality. Support for the Oculus Rift headsets has already been jerry-rigged into games like Skyrim and Grand Theft Auto, but newer games like Elite: Dangerous, come with headset support built right in. Many tried-and-true user interface metaphors in gaming must be adjusted for VR but the industry has been quick to adapt as the hardware for true Virtual Reality gaming has become more widely available.

				<h2>Major Players</h2>
				<p>Originally funded as a Kickstarter project in 2012 and engineered with the help of John Carmack (founder of Id Software, of Doom and Quake fame), Oculus became the early leader in Virtual Reality hardware for video games. Facebook bought Oculus in 2014 and brought the company’s high-end VR HMD to market for consumers. More recently, Oculus has seen success with the lower-price, lower-powered Oculus Go, and 2019 saw the release of multiple new iterations on the hardware, including the tethered Rift S and the stand-alone Oculus Quest. </p>
				<p>In Virtual Reality, the computer uses similar sensors and maths. However, rather than locating a real camera within a physical environment, the position of the user’s eyes are located within the simulated environment. If the user’s head turns, the graphics react accordingly. Rather than compositing virtual objects and a real scene, VR technology creates a convincing, interactive world for the user. </p>
